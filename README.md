# ðŸš€ Project Description: High-Growth Company Analysis with SQL
Welcome to the High-Growth Company Analysis project! In this project, we aim to provide valuable insights to an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. By leveraging SQL and the provided unicorns database, we will identify industries with the highest valuations and determine the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging.

The unicorns database contains four tables: dates, funding, industries, and companies. These tables provide essential information about company details, funding data, industry classification, and geographic location.

Our objective is to identify the top-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined. From these industries, we will further extract information such as the number of unicorns within each industry, the year they became a unicorn, and their average valuation (converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places).

To achieve this, we will utilize SQL queries, employing concepts such as joins, filtering, grouping, and aggregating data. By presenting the investment firm with these insights, we empower them with a competitive edge in understanding industry trends and guiding their portfolio structuring for future success.

In a world where being average is not enough, this project allows us to dig deeper and uncover opportunities for high-growth investments. So, let's dive into the unicorns database, analyze the data, and provide the investment firm with actionable insights for their investment strategies.

Let's get started on this exciting journey of analyzing high-growth companies and unlocking investment potential!

Note: This project is based on real-world scenarios and utilizes the unicorns database to simulate the data analysis process. The project demonstrates SQL skills in analyzing company trends, industry performance, and valuation metrics.
